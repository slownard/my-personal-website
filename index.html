            I'm a 22 year old software engineer from Jersey City, NJ with an eagerness to become a better programmer. I
            am a proud college dropout who is currently enrolled into a coding bootcamp at Flatiron School. I tried out
            two different majors, one being Biblical studies and the other, business administration. After the start of
            my sophmore year of college, it was clear to me that taking the traditional 4 year college route to get into
            a career just wasn't for me.

            looked into frontend development and began to learn a bit of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through CodeAcademy
            online courses. Although I was able to get a grasp of those languages, I decided to look into coding
            bootcamps so that I could jumpstart my career in software engineering.
